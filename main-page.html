      <p>I am Arif. I like to develop and play games. I mainly do programming, design and VFX in projects. I have participated in game jams, from Global Game Jam
        to Ludum Dare and even smaller itch.io game jams. I also have been playing the guitar and bass since I can remember. I love tabletop RPGs and board games
        including D&D, Magic the Gathering, etc. I also have some Dungeon Mastering experience playing tabletop RPGs.

          <p>Cardbuster is a merge between action-adventure and deckbuilder genres. While keeping the
            strategic style of a deckbuilder, we wanted to make an action filled real-time game.
            In Cardbuster you use Cards which grant you abilities for a limited time to change the gameplay.
            <br>
            <br>
            After implementing basic movement I have developed the architecture of the ability system.
            I have used Scriptable Objects as a way to store information about the abilities' both aesthetic and
            mechanical elements. Mechanical elements include damage, damageType, effectRadius,
            radiusAngle, abilityTarget, abilityDuration, attackSpeed etc. Aesthetic elements include name,
            abilityImage, vfx, sfx etc. Using a card utilizes this stored information to enable using the
            corresponding ability to either defeat enemies or overcome platforming challenges.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also have made VFX such as ability effects. I have prepared sprites to use in Unity's Particle
            Effects and Visual Effect Graph tools working on Adobe Photoshop.

            can carry either keys to open doors or power-ups. There are power-ups such as 'Feet' which enable you to
            walk faster/jump and if you have 2 'Feet' items you can double-jump, 'Umbrella item enables you to glide long
