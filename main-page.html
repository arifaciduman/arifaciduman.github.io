    <div class="introduction">
      <p>I am Arif. I like to develop and play games. I mainly do programming and game design in projects, but lately I
        have been dabbling in VFX. I have participated in Global Game Jam, Ludum Dare and even smaller itch.io game jams.
        I also have been playing the guitar and bass since I can remember. I love both playing and Dungeon Mastering
        tabletop RPGs and board games including D&D, Magic the Gathering, etc.

          <p>Cardbuster is a merge between action-adventure and deckbuilder genres. In Cardbuster, Player uses Cards that
            grant them abilities for a limited time to change the gameplay. Casting a card fills the matching ability slot
            to use the corresponding ability for a period of time to either defeat enemies (video 1) or overcome platforming
            challenges (video 2). Like classic deckbuilder games you mulligan/draw your hand before a combat begins (video 1).<br>

            <h3>My contributions</h3>
            <p>After implementing basic movement I have developed the architecture of the ability system. I have used
              Scriptable Objects as a way to store information about the abilities' both aesthetic and mechanical elements.
              Mechanical elements include damage, damageType, effectRadius, radiusAngle, abilityTarget, abilityDuration,
              attackSpeed etc. Aesthetic elements include name, abilityImage, VFX, SFX etc.<br>
              <br>
              I also have made some ability effect VFX. I have prepared sprites on Adobe Photoshop to use in Unity3D's
              Particle Effects and Visual Effect Graph tools (video 3).</p>

            platformer game in which Player tries to stay in the light radius while the light object moves forward on its
            own (video 1) to keep the sanity level high. Player loses sanity if they stay out of the light (video 2). If the sanity
            bar drops to zero or player hits the spikes the game ends (video 3). Player gains points as long as they stay alive.
            Player increases their score multiplier proportional to how close they are to the light source.<br>

            <h3>My contributions</h3>
            <p>I did all the programming and level design of this game using Unity3D.<br>For the movement of light I have
              prepared a rail system by setting up a list of points and increasing the index of the nextPoint according
              to the proximity of the light to the current nextPoint. After checking if the player is close enough to the
              light by a simple distance calculation I had to determine if the player was in the dark or not by casting
              rays to see if there was an obstacle between the light and the player. I have used experimental 2d light
              feature of Unity3D's Universal Render Pipeline to achieve the desired light/dark effect.</p>

          <p>Back to Hometown is a game made for an Itch.io minijam (theme: Colors). In Back to Hometown, Player plays as a wizard who
            returns to their town after many years to find it corrupted by an alien force. Using Player's abilities, kill
            monsters and cleanse the area. 1st ability is a single projectile fired from Player's staff (video 1).
            2nd ability is an area of effect damage cast in front of the Player (video 1). 3rd ability is an area of effect
            ability cast around the player which heals themselves and clears the corruption around (video 2). Boss corrupts
            an adjacent tile every few seconds and corrupted tiles allow portals to open above them that spawn more monsters
            (video 3).<br>

            <h3>My contributions</h3>
            <p>I did programming, game design and level design of this game.<br> I like the alien corruption theme and
              wanted to create this effect not just visually but also gameplay-wise. I have used Unity3D's Tilemap feature
              to have a 2D map. The starting corruption point is the tile under the center of the Boss. From that point in
              random intervals all adjacent tiles are corrupted one by one, meaning their sprites are changed and tags are
              set to "Corrupted". Portals check under them to see if the tag of tile they are on is "Corrupted". If it is
              they activate and start spawning mobs. "Cleanse" skill (video 2) works in a similar way by setting the tags
              of tiles under and adjacent to the Player to "Normal" and changing their sprite to a flowery one. Monster AI
              is a simple Move, Attack, Cooldown system.</p>

            building/tile Player receives points. While cleansing a building restores it, cleansing a road tile destroys the
            tile (video 2), so Player needs to be careful to not fall into the abyss through destroyed parts of the road (video 3).<br>
