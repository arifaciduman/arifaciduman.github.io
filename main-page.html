      <p>Hi! I am Arif. I have been developing video games for the past 5+ years. I am mainly a programmer and game designer,
        but I am also working on VFX. I started game development by participating in game jams such as Global Game Jam, Ludum 
        Dare and even smaller itch.io game jams. In my free time I like to play music, cook, and play tablotop games/rpgs.

            Like classic deckbuilder games you mulligan/draw your hand before a combat begins.<br>

            bar drops to zero or player hits the spikes the game ends (video 3). Player gains points as long as they stay alive.
            Player increases their score multiplier proportional to how close they are to the light source.<br>

            2nd ability is an area of effect damage cast in front of the Player (video 1). 3rd ability is an area of effect
            ability cast around the player which heals themselves and clears the corruption around (video 2). Boss corrupts
            an adjacent tile every few seconds and corrupted tiles allow portals to open above them that spawn more monsters

              I have programmed monster AI so that they don't wander under the sun themselves and chase after the Player when 
              They get in range (video 2). Since the planet Player is on is stationary, Monster AI checks the "Vector3 nextPoint" 
              3d position vector they will move next to see if the horizontal x of the nextPoint falls in positive values, if it 
              does then the function determines the nextPoint again randomly. I also implemented the lighting settings and movement 
              of the sun and moon around the planet (video 3).

              I did all the programming and level design while taking part in the game design process.
              Corruption effect is achieved in a similar manner to "Back to Hometown". The difference 
              is all the buildings and road pieces are stored in "Roads" and "Buildings" lists at the 
              start of the game and removed from it when it gets corrupted.
