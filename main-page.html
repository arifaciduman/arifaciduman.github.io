    <div class="introduction">
      <p>I am Arif. I like to develop and play games. I mainly do programming and game design in projects, but lately I
        have been dabbling in VFX. I have participated in Global Game Jam, Ludum Dare and even smaller itch.io game jams.
        I also have been playing the guitar and bass since I can remember. I love both playing and Dungeon Mastering
        tabletop RPGs and board games including D&D, Magic the Gathering, etc.

          <p>Cardbuster is a merge between action-adventure and deckbuilder genres. In Cardbuster you use Cards which
            grant you abilities for a limited time to change the gameplay.<br>
            <br>
            After implementing basic movement I have developed the architecture of the ability system. I have used
            Scriptable Objects as a way to store information about the abilities' both aesthetic and mechanical elements.
            Mechanical elements include damage, damageType, effectRadius, radiusAngle, abilityTarget, abilityDuration,
            attackSpeed etc. Aesthetic elements include name, abilityImage, vfx, sfx etc. Using a card utilizes this
            stored information to enable using the corresponding ability to either defeat enemies or overcome platforming
            challenges.<br>
            <br>
            I also have made ability effect VFX. I have prepared sprites on Adobe Photoshop to use in Unity3D's Particle
            Effects and Visual Effect Graph tools.
